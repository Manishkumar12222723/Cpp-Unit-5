Problem statement



In an eco-conscious household, a smart energy monitoring system is implemented to track electricity usage for three key appliances: a Fan, a Light, and a TV.



The system has three classes: "Fan," "Light," and "TV" - all inheriting from a base class named "currentBill." Each class includes attributes for the watts (power consumption) and the number of hours the appliance is used.



When the user interacts with the system, they provide the power consumption (in watts) and the usage hours for each appliance. The system then calculates the electricity consumption for each device, converting it to kilowatt-hours (kWh) based on the formula (watts * hours / 1000). The energy cost is assumed to be $1.5 per kWh.



Write a program using virtual functions to accomplish this task.

Input format :
The first line consists of the power rating of the fan and the total hours used, separated by space.

The second line consists of the power rating of Light and the total hours used, separated by space.

The third line consists of the power rating of the TV and the total hours used, separated by space.

Output format :
The output prints the bill amount, rounding off to two decimal places.

Code constraints :
Power rating > 0

Total hours > 0

Problem Statement



A car rental company wants to calculate the total cost of a rental based on the number of days and the type of car rented. The company has set rental rates for different car types, which are stored in the following constants:



ECONOMY_RATE: $40.00 per day

COMPACT_RATE: $50.00 per day

STANDARD_RATE: $60.00 per day



The program should take as input the number of days and the type of car. The type of car is an optional parameter with a default value of "Economy". The program defines a base class "car" with the virtual function "calculateRentalCost" and three derived classes "EconomyCar", "CompactCar" and "StandardCar" override "calculateRentalCost" to calculate the total cost of the rental.



Function signature:

double calculateRentalCost(int numDays, string carType = "Economy")



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Wipro recruitment.

Input format :
An integer numDays (1 <= numDays <= 365), the number of days of the rental.

A string carType, the type of car (either "Economy", "Compact", or "Standard").

Output format :
If the carType is one of the valid types, output double, the total cost of the rental, rounded to 2 decimal places.

If the carType is not valid, output "Invalid car type."

Code constraints :
The rental rates for different car types are stored in constants and cannot be changed.

If carType is not specified, the default value is "Economy".

The number of days is an integer between 1 and 365, inclusive.

The output should be rounded to two decimal places.

The program should use the calculateRentalCost function to calculate the rental cost.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
3 Compact
Output 1 :
The total cost of the rental is $150
Input 2 :
5 Economy
Output 2 :
The total cost of the rental is $200
Input 3 :
5 SUV
Output 3 :
Invalid car type.
Input 4 :
2 Standard
Output 4 :
The total cost of the rental is $120

Problem Statement



Kamalesh is building a spell-checking system for a word-processing application. He needs to write a program that calculates the minimum number of operations required to transform one word into another.



Specifically, the program takes two strings as input and computes their edit distance. The program defines a base class "EditDistanceCalculator" with a pure virtual function "min" and a derived class "MinEditDistanceCalculator" override the "min" function to calculate the minimum edit distance. Write a program to accomplish this task.



Example



Input:

kitten

sitting



Output:

The edit distance between kitten and sitting is 3



Explanation:

To transform "kitten" into "sitting", we can perform the following operations:

Substitute "s" for "k": sitten
Substitute "i" for "e": sittin
Insert "g" at the end: sitting
Thus, the minimum number of operations required to transform "kitten" into "sitting" is 3.

Input format :
The input consists of two strings on separate lines.

Output format :
The output displays the edit distance between the strings.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
Length of string1<=100

Length of string2<=100

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
kitten
sitting
Output 1 :
Edit distance between kitten and sitting is 3
Input 2 :
intention
execution
Output 2 :
Edit distance between intention and execution is 5

        int len2 = str2.length();
        int dist[len1 + 1][len2 + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i <= len1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= len2; j++) {
                if (i == 0) {
                    dist[i][j] = j;

Problem statement



Sheela is developing a billing system for a supermarket. The supermarket has a loyalty program where customers earn reward points based on the total amount spent during their shopping. To calculate reward points, she needs to implement a function that takes an array of transaction amounts and finds the sum of the digits of each transaction amount.



If the sum of digits is more than one digit, further add the digits until a single-digit result is obtained. Finally, the total reward points earned by the customer will be the sum of these single-digit results.



The program defines a base class "SummationCalculator" with a pure virtual function "sum" and a derived class "SimpleSummationCalculator" that overrides the "sum" function to calculate the sum of the digits. Write a program to accomplish this task.





Function Prototype: int sum(int a[ ],int n);



Example:

Input:

5

111 234 121 900 101

Output:

9

Explanation:

111 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3

234 = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9

121 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4

900 = 9 + 0 + 0 = 9

101 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2



The sum of the digits of all the given numbers is 3 + 9 + 4 + 9 + 2 = 27.

So, the final output is 2+ 7 = 9.



Input format :
The first line of the input consists of a single value, n.

The next line consists of an array of elements separated by a space.

Output format :
The output prints the sum of the digits of all the numbers in the array.

Code constraints :
Array size < 100

Array elements < 1000

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
111 234 121 900 101
Output 1 :

roblem Statement



Max is an organizer of the school's science fair. His aim is to create an engaging program that introduces attendees to the delightful world of fruits and their tastes. The interactive program will be designed with a base class called Fruit, and it will have derived classes representing specific fruits such as Apple, Banana, Orange, Grape, and Pineapple.



During the event, the attendees will have the opportunity to participate in a fruit tasting experience. The program will prompt the participants with a question like, "Which fruit would you like to taste?" and present a list of available options, including Apple, Banana, Orange, Grape, and Pineapple.



Once a participant chooses a fruit, the program will display the taste of the selected fruit using the getTaste() function, which will be implemented in each derived class to return the respective taste of the fruit.



Taste of the fruits:

Apple: Sweet

Banana: Creamy

Orange: Tangy

Grape: Juicy

Pineapple: Sweet and Sour



Example:

Choose a fruit (1 = Apple, 2 = Banana, 3 = Orange, 4 = Grape, 5 = Pineapple): 1

The taste of the fruit is: Sweet.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Capgemini recruitment.

Input format :
The input consists of a single integer "n", which represents the user's choice of fruit.

Output format :
The output consists of a string indicating the taste of the chosen fruit.

If an invalid input is entered, a default message will be displayed.



Refer to the sample output for format specifications.

Code constraints :
The user's input should be a single integer.

The user can only enter values from 1 to 5 to choose a fruit. Any other value will be considered an invalid choice, and the program will default to displaying "Generic fruit taste."

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1
Output 1 :
The taste of the fruit is: Sweet
Input 2 :
8
Output 2 :
Invalid choice, defaulting to generic fruit.
