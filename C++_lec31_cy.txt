Shalu is tasked with developing a calendar application that allows users to view the calendar layout for a specific month and year. The application should prompt the user to enter the desired month (1–12) and year. The program should then validate the user input to ensure it's within the valid range.



Once the input is validated, the application should calculate the day of the week for the first day of the specified month and display a calendar layout for that month. The calendar should show the days of the month, starting on Monday and ending on Sunday, with proper formatting to align the days correctly.



Additionally, the program should handle leap years correctly by determining the number of days in February based on the input year.



Your task is to implement getDayOfWeek, isLeapYear, getDaysInMonth, and the main function as provided in the given code to fulfill the requirements of the calendar application. Ensure that the calendar layout is generated accurately for the specified month and year and that the days are aligned correctly in the output. Properly manage memory allocation and deallocation for the calendar layout to avoid memory leaks. Test the application with various inputs to verify its correctness and usability.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Capgemini recruitment.

Input format :
The input consists of two integers, which represent the month and year in separate lines.

Output format :
If the user enters invalid input (e.g., month out of range, negative year), the program should display an error message indicating that the input is invalid.

If the input is valid, the program will generate a formatted calendar layout for the specified month and year.

The calendar will be displayed with the days of the month arranged in rows and columns, starting from Sunday to Saturday.

The month and year for which the calendar is displayed will be shown in the header.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The month should be an integer in the range of 1 to 12.

The year should be a non-negative integer.

The program assumes that the user will input valid integers for month and year. It does not handle non-integer inputs or inputs with fractional parts.

The code is implemented to work with the Gregorian calendar system, which is the most widely used calendar system in the world. It will not work accurately for dates before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1582.

Problem Statement



Jessi is designing a program to help a mathematician analyze large numbers and find the largest prime factor. Your program should dynamically allocate memory to store the prime factors of the given number and then display the largest prime factor as the result.



Write a program that takes an integer n as input and dynamically allocates memory to create an array to store the prime factors of n. Calculate and store all prime factors of n in the dynamically allocated array. Finally, print the largest prime factor.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Wipro recruitment.

Input format :
The input consists of a single integer, n. This integer represents the number for which you need to find the largest prime factor.

Output format :
The program outputs two lines.

The first line displays all the prime factors of the input number n separated by a space.

The second line displays the largest prime factor among them.

If the n is less than 2, it will be prints "No prime factors found for" with n value.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
2 <= n <= 999

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
2
Output 1 :
Prime factors of 2 are: 2 
Largest prime factor of 2 is: 2
Input 2 :
1
Output 2 :
No prime factors found for 1
