Nithya is developing a simple inventory management system for a small shop. The shop owner wants to keep track of the prices of various items in the shop. Each item has a unique ID and a corresponding price. The shop owner wants to be able to add and update item prices as new items arrive or the prices change.



To implement this inventory management system, you have created a base class called Shop, which has an array to store the item IDs and their prices. The Shop class also contains a pure virtual function, setPrice, which allows the derived classes to set the price of each item.



The derived class ConcreteShop inherits from the base class Shop and provides its implementation for the setPrice function. The ConcreteShop class allows the shop owner to add or update the prices of items in the inventory.



In the main function, you create an object of the ConcreteShop class named dukaan. The program prompts the user to enter the number of items they want to add or update in the inventory. For each item, the user provides the item ID and its price, and the program updates the inventory accordingly.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer n, representing the number of items to add or update in the inventory.

The next n lines contain two space-separated integers, id and price, each representing the item ID and its corresponding price.

Output format :
If there are n items, the program will output n lines, each containing the price of the item with the corresponding ID.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The number of items, n, is a positive integer.1 ≤ n ≤ 100

Each item ID is unique and within the range of 1 to 1000.

Each item's price is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10000.

Problem Statement



Akshitha is tasked with developing a program to determine the day of the week based on a given integer input representing a day number (1 to 7). In this scenario, each integer from 1 to 7 corresponds to a specific day of the week, as follows:



1: Sunday

2: Monday

3: Tuesday

4: Wednesday

5: Thursday

6: Friday

7: Saturday



The program should take an integer input from the user representing the day number and output the corresponding day of the week. If the input is not within the range of 1 to 7, the program should print "Invalid."



You need to create a class named Main that handles this functionality. The constructor of the class Main takes an integer argument representing the day number. The class should then determine the day of the week based on the input and print the result to the console.



You should also ensure that the class Main has a virtual destructor to allow for proper cleanup when deleting objects through a base-class pointer.

Input format :
The input is a single integer d, representing the day number.

Output format :
The output displays a string representing the corresponding day of the week. If the input d is within the range of 1 to 7, the program should output the day of the week.

If the input d is outside this range, the program should output "Invalid".



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specification.

Code constraints :
1 <= d <= 7

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
7
Output 1 :
Saturday
Input 2 :
0
Output 2 :
Invalid
Input 3 :

Problem Statement



Santhosh is designing a painting application that allows users to select a color and paint on a digital canvas. Your task is to enhance the painting application by adding a user-friendly menu that prompts the user to choose a color to paint on the canvas. The user can input either 'R' or 'r' to select the Red color or 'B' or 'b' to select the Blue color.



Write a program to implement runtime polymorphism. The program should define a base class "Color" with a virtual function "paint" and two derived classes "RedPaint" and "BluePaint" that override the "paint()" function to paint with the respective colors.



The program should use runtime polymorphism to create either a "RedPaint" or "BluePaint" object based on user input and call the "paint()" function to paint with the chosen color.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Cocubes recruitment.

Input format :
The input consists of a single character representing the color to paint, where "R" or "r" represents the red color and "B" or "b" represents a blue color.

Output format :
The program should output the message "I'm Painting with Red Color." if the user inputs 'R' or 'r', or "I'm Painting with Blue Color."



If the user inputs "B" or "b". If the user inputs any other character, the program should output "Invalid choice!" and terminate.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The user's input must be a single character.

The user can only enter 'R', 'r', 'B', or 'b' to select a color. Any other character will be considered an invalid choice.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
R
Output 1 :
I'm Painting with Red color.
Input 2 :
B
Output 2 :
I'm Painting with Blue color.

Problem Statement



Kaniska is tasked with creating a program that allows users to input information about different types of vehicles and calculate the time it takes for these vehicles to travel a given distance at their maximum speeds. The program will support three types of vehicles: Cars, Bicycles, and Boats.



Your task is to implement the Vehicle class as the base class for these three vehicle types. The Vehicle class should have the following properties and functionalities:



Properties:

numOfWheels (integer): representing the number of wheels of the vehicle.

maxSpeed (floating-point): representing the maximum speed of the vehicle.



Functionalities:

A default constructor to initialize numOfWheels and maxSpeed to 0.

A virtual function setNumOfWheels(int wheels) to set the number of wheels of the vehicle.

A virtual function setMaxSpeed(float speed) to set the maximum speed of the vehicle.

A virtual function getNumOfWheels() to get the number of wheels on the vehicle.

A virtual function getMaxSpeed() to get the maximum speed of the vehicle.

A virtual function timeToTravel(float distance) that calculates and returns the time it takes for the vehicle to travel the given distance at its maximum speed.



Implement three derived classes, Car, Bicycle, and Boat, which inherit from the Vehicle class. Each derived class should override the timeToTravel(float distance) function with the appropriate calculation for the specific vehicle type. The Car and Bicycle classes should calculate the time based on their maximum speed in mph, while the Boat class should consider the maximum speed in knots and convert it to mph using the formula 1 knot = 1.151 mph.



In the main function, create instances of each vehicle type (Car, Bicycle, and Boat) and take user input for the number of wheels and maximum speed for each vehicle. Then, the user will input a distance, and the program will display the details of each vehicle and the time it takes for each vehicle to travel the given distance at its maximum speed.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Capgemini recruitment.

Input format :
The first line consists of the number of wheels and the maximum speed of the car, separated by a single space.

The third line consists of the number of wheels and the maximum speed of the bicycle, separated by a single space.

The fifth line consists of the maximum speed of the boat (in knots).

The sixth line consists of the distance to travel (in miles).

Output format :
The program outputs the details of the car, bicycle, and boat, including the number of wheels and the maximum speed for each vehicle, as well as the time it would take to travel the specified distance at maximum speed.

The output includes the vehicle type, number of wheels, maximum speed, and time taken to travel the distance.

The time taken is displayed in hours.



Refer to the sample input and output for format specifications.

Code constraints :
The number of wheels (numOfWheels) for each vehicle is a positive integer.

The maximum speed (maxSpeed) for each vehicle is a positive floating-point number.

The distance to travel is a positive floating-point number.

The maximum speed of the Boat (in knots) should be converted to mph using the formula: 1 knot = 1.151 mph.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
4 60
2 15
30
50
Output 1 :
Vehicle Details:
Car has 4 wheels and can go up to 60 mph. It would take 0.833333 hours to travel 50 miles at maximum speed.
Bicycle has 2 wheels and can go up to 15 mph. It would take 3.33333 hours to travel 50 miles at maximum speed.
Boat has 0 wheels and can go up to 30 knots. It would take 1.44802 hours to travel 50 miles at maximum speed.
Input 2 :
4 90
2 20
35
75
Output 2 :
Vehicle Details:
Car has 4 wheels and can go up to 90 mph. It would take 0.833333 hours to travel 75 miles at maximum speed.
Bicycle has 2 wheels and can go up to 20 mph. It would take 3.75 hours to travel 75 miles at maximum speed.
Boat has 0 wheels and can go up to 35 knots. It would take 1.86174 hours to travel 75 miles at maximum speed.

Single File Programming Question
Function Overloading:



An ice cream vendor sells his ice cream in cone-shaped (radius r and height h) and square-shaped (side r) containers. However, he is unsure of the quantity that can be filled in the two containers.



You are required to write a program that prints the volume of the containers, given their respective dimensions as input. Your class must be named "Icecream," which has two methods with the same name, "Quantity," each having the respective dimensions of the containers as the parameters. 



Function Prototype:

Quantity(int r, int h)

Quantity(int r)



Formulas:

A cone's volume is equal to 0.33*pi*r*r*h.

The volume of a square is r*r*r.



Note: Use M_PI for pi



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Amcat recruitment.

Input format :
The first line of the input consists of the choice (1 for square, 2 for cone).

If the choice is 1, enter the side of the square.

If the choice is 2, enter the radius and height of the cone, separated by a space.



Note: The input type should be an integer.

Output format :
The output must display the volume of the container, rounded off to two decimal places, for which the dimensions are given.



Refer to the sample output for format specifications.

Code constraints :
The integer "n" will be either 1 or 2.

1 ≤ "r", "h" ≤ 106 (radius and height of the ice cream).

The output will have a precision of 2 decimal places.

Problem Statement



Gowtham is required to implement a basic class hierarchy for a program that deals with numerical data. The hierarchy consists of a base class Demo and a derived class, Derived.



Implement the Demo class with the following specifications:

Private members: num1 and num2 of type int
Public constructor: Accepts two integers, n1 and n2, and initializes num1 with n1 and num2 with n2.
Public member functions:
int getNum1() const: Returns the value of num1.

int getNum2() const: Returns the value of num2.

virtual void display(): Prints the values of num1 and num2.



Implement the Derived class, which is derived from the Demo class, with the following specifications:

Public constructor: Accepts two integers, n1 and n2, and passes them to the base class constructor.
Public member function:
void display(): Overrides the display() function in the base class and prints the values of num1 and num2 with a prefix "Derived - ".



You need to implement the classes and demonstrate their functionality in the main() function. The main() function should take two integer inputs from the user and create an object of the Derived class using these input values. It should then display the values using the overridden display() method and delete the dynamically allocated object using a base class pointer to avoid any memory leaks.



Note: The program should display appropriate messages indicating the constructor and destructor calls for each class.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Accenture recruitment.

Input format :
The input consists of the numbers to be assigned to n1 and n2, respectively, separated by a space.
