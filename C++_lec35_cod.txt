Janu has been assigned to develop a basic calculator application that performs four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application should be implemented using object-oriented programming concepts.



You are required to implement a calculator application that allows users to perform arithmetic operations on two numbers. The application should have a base class operationsBase that declares four pure virtual functions: addition(), subtraction(), multiplication(), and division(). This base class will act as an interface for the calculator's operations.



Next, you need to create a derived class, operationsDerived, that inherits from the operationsBase class. This derived class should implement the four arithmetic operations using the two private integer member variables a and b.



The main function should create an object of the operationsDerived class and prompt the user to enter two integer values. Then, it should perform each operation and display the results.

Input format :
The input consists of two integer values, a and b, separated by a space.

Output format :
The output displays the results of the four arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Each result will be separated by a space.

In the case of division by zero, an error message will be displayed on a separate line.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The input integers a and b should be within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647).

The division operation should be valid, i.e., the value of b should not be zero.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
20 10
Output 1 :
30 10 200 2 
Input 2 :
5248 0
Output 2 :
5248 5248 0 
Division by 0 is not allowed.
Input 3 :
-10 10
Output 3 :
0 -20 -100 -1

Create a simple banking application that allows customers to interact with their savings account. Implement an abstract base class Account with pure virtual functions display(), deposit(double amount), and withdraw(double amount). 



Create a derived class called savingsAccount that inherits from Account. The savingsAccount class should allow users to input their account number, name, and initial balance. It should also provide functionality for depositing and withdrawing money, displaying the updated balance, and handling insufficient balance scenarios during withdrawals.

Input format :
The input consists of the following components:



If the choice is 1, enter the accountnumber (integer), name (a string without spaces), and balance (a floating-point number) representing account details.

If the choice is 2 (deposit) or 3 (withdrawal), a floating-point number represents the deposit or withdrawal amount.

Output format :
Output displays (choice 1) the three space-separated values: accountnumber (integer), name (string), and balance (floating-point number) with two decimal places.



If the choice is either 2 (deposit) or 3 (withdrawal),

The output will display a message indicating the result of the transaction:

"Balance after deposit: updated_balance": If a deposit transaction is successful.

"Balance after withdrawal: updated_balance": If a withdrawal transaction is successful.

"Insufficient balance for withdrawal!": If the withdrawal amount is greater than the account balance.



Refer to the sample output for the formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The value of choice can only be 1.

The value of accno will be a positive integer.

The value of name will be a string containing alphabets and/or digits (no spaces).

The value of balance will be a non-negative floating-point number.

The value of the option can only be 2 or 3.

Problem Statement



Imagine you are developing an online shopping store where customers can purchase different types of items. The store offers two main categories of items: "Wooden Items" and "Electronics." As part of the system, you are required to create a program that calculates the total amount a customer needs to pay based on the type and quantity of items they choose to purchase.



ItemType (Abstract Base Class): This is an abstract base class that defines a pure virtual function calculateAmount() which calculates the total amount of the items to be purchased. It acts as a blueprint for the derived classes.



Wooden (Derived from ItemType): This class represents wooden items available in the store. It has two private data members: noOfItems (representing the quantity of wooden items) and cost (representing the cost of each wooden item). The class implements the calculateAmount() function by multiplying the quantity with the cost per item.



Electronics (Derived from ItemType): This class represents electronic items available in the store. It has one private data member cost (representing the cost of the electronic item). The class implements the calculateAmount() function by applying a 20% discount on the cost of the electronic item.



Finally, the program should display the total amount for the customer's purchase based on the selected type of items, considering any discounts or unique costs for wooden items.

Input format :
The first line of the input consists of the choice.

If the choice is 1, enter the number of items and their cost.

If the choice is 2, enter the cost.

Output format :
The output consists of a single line with the calculated total amount for the customer's purchase. Round off the output to two decimal places.

Code constraints :
The value of choice can only be 1 or 2.

For wooden items:

The value of noOfItems will be a positive integer.

The value of cost will be a non-negative floating-point number.

For electronic items:

The value of cost will be a non-negative floating-point number.

Satha is working on a project that involves number manipulation using object-oriented programming. Your task is to create a class hierarchy that allows you to perform various operations on an integer and display the result. The base class, "A", is an abstract class with a pure virtual function, print(), while the derived class, "B", implements this function and provides additional functionalities for number operations.



Write a program to find whether the given number(x) is even or odd; if it is even, then print the cube(x)+square(x) otherwise, print cube(x)-square(x).



Create a base class with a pure virtual function, void print(). Print the result by implementing this virtual function in the derived class.

Input format :
The input consists of an Integer.

Output format :
If the given number is even, the output will be the sum of the cube and square of the number.

If the given number is odd, the output will be the difference between the cube and square of the number.

Problem Statement



You are tasked with developing a simple electricity billing system for a household. The household has three types of electrical appliances: Fans, Lights, and TVs. Each appliance is rated with a specific power consumption in watts (w) and the number of hours (hrs) it is used per day. The electricity tariff is based on the total energy consumed by all the appliances, and the cost is calculated as follows:



For each appliance, the total energy consumption (in kWh) is calculated as the product of its power rating (in watts) and the number of hours it is used per day.



The cost for each appliance is determined by multiplying the total energy consumption (in kWh) by the electricity tariff rate, which is $1.5 per kWh.



To implement the electricity billing system, create an abstract class currentBill, which will serve as the base class for three derived classes: Fan, Light, and TV. Each derived class will implement the amount() function to calculate the electricity bill for the specific appliance type.

Input format :
The first line consists of the power rating of the fan and the total hours used, separated by space.

The second line consists of the power rating of the light and the total hours used, separated by space.

The third line consists of the power rating of the TV and the total hours used, separated by space.

Output format :
The output prints the total bill amount.

Code constraints :
Power rating >0

Total hours >0

Problem Statement



The Human Resources Department at ABC Corporation needs a program to manage employee information and find the highest-paid employee. They require a concrete class named "Employee" to represent individual employee details. The "Employee" class should be a concrete implementation with private attributes to store the employee name, employee ID, and monthly salary. The class should provide methods to update the salary and display the employee's information.



Once the user provides the employee details, the program should create an array of "Employee" objects and store each employee's information in the array.



Next, the program should find the highest-paid employee among the entered employees and display their details, including their name, employee ID, and monthly salary.



To achieve this, the program should define the "Employee" class as a concrete class with appropriate member functions to manage the employee information. The class should include a constructor to initialize the employee details, a function to update the salary, and a function to display the employee's information.



Finally, after displaying the highest-paid employee's details, the program should deallocate the memory used for the array of employees before terminating.

Input format :
The first line of input contains an integer, which represents the total number of employees in the company.

For each employee, there will be three lines of input:

The employee's name (a string containing alphabets and spaces).
The employee's ID (an integer)
The employee's salary (an integer)
Output format :
The output will display the details of the highest-paid employee.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The number of employees will be a positive integer (1 <= numEmployees <= 1000).

Each employee's name will be a string containing alphabets and spaces only. The length of the name will not exceed 100 characters.

Employee ID will be a positive integer (1 <= employeeID <= 10000).

Salary will be a floating-point number, representing the employee's monthly salary. Salary will be in the range of 1000 to 100000.

Problem Statement



Design a program to calculate the total price of products in an online store based on their specific pricing rules. The program should utilize an abstract class called "Product" to represent a generic product and provide a framework for calculating the total price. Implement two derived classes, "Electronics" and "Apparel," which inherit from the abstract class and provide their own implementations for calculating the total price based on their specific pricing rules.



Note: The abstract class "Product" serves as a blueprint for the derived classes "Electronics" and "Apparel." It enforces the implementation of a "calculateTotalPrice" method in the derived classes to calculate the total price based on their specific pricing rules. This approach ensures code reusability and flexibility to accommodate various types of products with their unique pricing calculations.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing mPhasis recruitment.

Input format :
The first line of the input represents the price of the electronics product.

The second line of the input represents the discount percentage for the electronics product.

The third line of the input represents the price of the apparel product.

The fourth line of the input represents the tax percentage for the apparel product.

Output format :
The total price of the electronics product after applying the discount.

The total price of the apparel product after applying the tax.

Code constraints :
The price, discount, and tax values are non-negative.

Problem Statement



You have been assigned the task of developing an investment returns calculation program. The program should allow users to input details about their investments and calculate the returns based on specific formulas. The program should follow these specifications:



Implement an abstract class called Investment with a pure virtual method calculateReturns(). Create concrete classes, such as Stock and Bond,  which inherit from the Investment class, to calculate returns for different types of investments.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Accenture recruitment.

Input format :
For each investment type:

The first line of the input contains the initial investment amount.

The next line contains the final value.

Output format :
For each investment type:

The first line of the output displays the type

The second line displays the Initial Investment.

The next line displays the Final Value.

The last line displays the calculated returns in percentage.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The initial investment amount and final value should be non-negative real numbers.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
1000
1500
2000
5000
Output 1 :
Type: Stock
Initial Investment: 1000.00
Final Value: 1500.00
Returns: 50.00%

Type: Bond
Initial Investment: 2000.00
Final Value: 5000.00
Returns: 150.00%
Input 2 :
250
120
350
480
Output 2 :
Type: Stock
Initial Investment: 250.00
Final Value: 120.00
Returns: -52.00%

Type: Bond
Initial Investment: 350.00
Final Value: 480.00
Returns: 37.14%

Problem Statement



Susana is required to implement a program that takes three strings as input and prints them in reverse order. To achieve this, you need to use a self-referential class called StringNode, which contains a character array to store a string and a pointer to another StringNode. The StringNode class provides a method to reverse the string stored in each node. The program should create three StringNode objects, each corresponding to one input string, and link them together in reverse order. 



Finally, the program should traverse the linked structure and print the reversed strings.



Note: This kind of question will help in clearing Deloitte recruitment.

Input format :
The input consists of three strings, each on a separate line.

Output format :
The output prints the reversed strings, each on a separate line.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The length of each input string will not exceed 100 characters.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
Cup
of
Tea
Output 1 :
