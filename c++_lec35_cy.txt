Problem Statement



In a chemical laboratory, researchers are studying the kinetics of a specific chemical reaction. They are interested in predicting the reaction rate at different time points to understand the reaction's behavior over time. The reaction involves multiple reactants, and the rate is determined by a specific reaction rate constant and reaction order. As a computer scientist, your task is to develop a program that takes inputs regarding the reactants, reaction rate constant, and reaction order, and calculates the reaction rate at a given time point using concrete class.



Example:

Input:

2    // Number of reactants (numReactants)

2 3   // Reactant concentrations

0.1   // Reaction rate constant

2    // Reaction order

5    // Time at which to calculate the reaction rate



Output:

The reaction rate at time 5 is: 3.6

Explanation:

In the given input, we have two reactants with concentrations 2 and 3. The reaction rate constant is 0.1, and the reaction order is 2. Using the formula for the reaction rate, we can calculate it as follows:



Reaction Rate = Reaction Rate Constant * (Concentration of Reactant 1 ^ Reaction Order) * (Concentration of Reactant 2 ^ Reaction Order)

Reaction Rate = 0.1 * (2 ^ 2) * (3 ^ 2) = 0.1 * 4 * 9 = 0.1 * 36 = 3.6

The reaction rate at time 5 is: 3.6

Input format :
The first line contains an integer (numReactants) representing the number of reactants in the chemical reaction.

The second line contains numReactants space-separated floating-point numbers (reactantConcentrations) representing the concentrations of the reactants.

The third line contains a single floating-point number (reactionRateConstant) representing the reaction rate constant.

The fourth line contains a single integer (reactionOrder) representing the reaction order.

The fifth line contains an integer (time) representing the time at which to calculate the reaction rate.

Output format :
The output displays a single line displaying the calculated reaction rate at the given time point.



Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.

Code constraints :
The number of reactants (numReactants) will be an integer between 1 and 5, inclusive.

The concentration of each reactant will be a floating-point number between 0.1 and 10.0, inclusive.

The reaction rate constant will be a floating-point number between 0.001 and 0.1, inclusive.

The reaction order will be an integer between 1 and 3, inclusive.

The time at which to calculate the reaction rate will be a floating-point number between 1.0 and 15.0, inclusive.
